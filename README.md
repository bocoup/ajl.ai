# Image Annotator
This tool is a work in progress collaboration between Bocoup Research and MIT Civic Media to build an open source tool for crowd sourcing image annotation. Our first campaign with the tool is an annotation project for the [IMDB-Wiki](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/), the popular computer vision face research data set.

You can read more about that campaign at [ajl.ai](https://ajl.ai).

This repo is currently structured as a base open source annotator, and the IMDB-wiki annotation campaign together.

Moving forward, we'll be working to publish reusable image annotation tools, along with our data and findings. In the meantime, this is a pretty good starting point if you're looking to run a large scale crowd image annotation campaign.  

## Repository Structure

- `backend` - back-end api written in node/express/postgress
- `frontend` - front-end client written in react/redux/webpack
- `jest` - unit and integration tests
- `prototypes/` - exploratory interaction prototypes
    + `fabric-test/` - prototypes using [fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) for rendering
    + `paper-test/` - prototype using [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) for rendering
    + `snap-svg-test/` - prototype using SVG to render landmarks
- `sample-data` - initial sample data from researchers
- `static` - initial static data for testing
- `api.md` - REST API reference documentation

## REST API
This project exposes a REST API with the following endpoints:
* get /api/annotations/types
* get /api/annotations/workload
* post /api/annotations

More information available in [api.md](blob/master/api.md).

## Deployment
Image Annotator is configured to be deployable on any Ubuntu 16 server. All
you need is Ansible 2.2x and root access to your desired target machine.

When orchestrating the official production or staging environments you will need
to submit a PR adding configuration for yourself to `ansible/vars/users.yml`.
Someone who already has access can provision your account and supply you with
the needed "Vault password" to enable deployment.

The following commands are available:

### npm run edit-secrets
This will open the secrets file in your default editor. Secret data is managed
by Ansible Vault. All secrets are stored in `ansible/vars/secrets.yml`.

### npm run provision:[production|staging|vagrant]
This will prepare a target machine with all system dependencies needed to
run Image Annotator and grant collaborators access to run deployments. You
will be prompted for both a Vault password and a SUDO password during this
task. You will have configured your sudo password at the beginning of the
project when you added yourself to `ansible/vars/users.yml`.

### npm run deploy:[production|staging|vagrant] -- -e commit=master
This will clone your desired commit to the target machine, install all node
dependencies, compile the site with webpack, apply any outstanding migrations
to the database and restart the API server.

### npm run database-restore:[production|staging|vagrant]
The database residing on the production server is backed up to S3 hourly.
Running this for any target server will completely replace the database
with the most recent backup. Take care not to do this for production
unless you know what you are doing!

## Installation
### Frontend
The front end is running React, Redux, Webpack.

Run `npm install` to install all front-end dependencies; then run `npm start` to launch the webpack dev server. The application will then be available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The front end currently needs the local node/postgres backend running (installation instructions below).

#### Other commands

These commands are available after installation within the `image-annotator/` directory:

- `npm test`: run unit tests with Jest, then lint on exit
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint to identify syntax & style issues in the code
- `npm run build`: generate a static build into `image-annotator/dist`
- `npm run storybook`: launch [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io) for component development (accessible at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) by default)

### backend
The backend is running node, PostgreSQL and an express based set of middlewares for the REST API we expose. In order to develop the application, you must have an installation of PostgreSQL.

#### Setting up Postgres
There are numerous ways to run PostgreSQL. Choose the one that is most familiar
to you!

**If you have Docker on your machine, do the following:**
```
docker run --name ia-pg -d -p 5432:5432 -i postgres
docker exec -it ia-pg su postgres -c 'CREATEDB image-annotator'
npm run migrate:up
npm start

# stop postgres
docker stop ia-pg

# start postgres
docker start ia-pg
```

**If you have VirtualBox and Vagrant on your machine, do the following:**
```
printf "PGHOST=10.10.0.100\nPGUSER=image-annotator" > .env
vagrant up
npm run provision:vagrant
npm run migrate:up
npm start

# stop postgres
vagrant halt

# start postgres
vagrant up
```

**If you want to install PostgreSQL locally on Ubuntu, do the following:**
```
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo service postgresql stop
sudo sh -c "printf 'local all all trust\nhost all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust\nhost all all ::1/128 trust' > /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf"
sudo service postgresql start
createdb -U postgres image-annotator
npm run migrate:up
npm start

# stop postgres
sudo service postgresql stop

# start postgres
sudo service postgresql start
```

**If you want to install PostgreSQL locally on OSX, do the following:**

Ensure you have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Then, run this:

```
printf "PGUSER=$USER" > .env
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
createdb image-annotator
npm run migrate:up
npm start

# stop postgres
brew services stop postgresql

# start postgres
brew services start postgresql
```

### Running the prototypes
`cd` into the prototypes directory you want to look at and run `npm start` (Requires python, equivalent to running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`) or a comparable static web server.

Navigate to the following prototypes in your browser:
* test on 25 sample landmarked images of faces [sample-data-rotate-regions](http://localhost:8000/prototypes/fabric-test/sample-data-rotate-regions.html)
* UI experiment for three annotation modes: [general fabric.js test](http://localhost:8000/prototypes/fabric-test/)

## Glossary of Terms

This section clarifies the verbiage and terms used within the application code.

### Attribute

An **attribute** is the object representing a specific type of annotation a user will apply to any given image, such as demographic attributes like "perceived ethnicity" or positional values like "the location of the right eye."

Attribute properties:

- **Name**: the human-oriented label of an attribute, such as "Perceived Gender."
- **Type**: the type of data represented by the attribute, *e.g.* a list of multiple-choice options, or a set of coordinates, etc. _Note: This is a database- / data model-oriented value, and has no inherent correspondence to front-end presentation._
- **Options**: the list of accepted values for a multiple-choice image attribute.

Attribute objects have the shape
```json
{
    "name": "Attribute Name",
    "type": "type-of-data",
    "options": ["list", "of", "accepted", "values", "for", "multiple", "choice", "attributes"]
}
```

### Annotation

An **annotation** is the object representing the submitted value for a particular [`Attribute`](#attribute).

Annotation properties:

- **Name**: the name of the image attribute annotated, such as "Perceived Ethnicity".
- **Value**: the value with which the image is annotated, such as "Asian" or "Black."

Annotation objects have the shape
```json
{
    "name": "Attribute Name",
    "value": "selected-value"
}
```

### ImageAnnotation

An **image annotation** is an object associating one or more [`Annotations`](#annotation) with the specific [`Image`](#image) to which they were applied. It contains an array of annotations, and the ID of their associated image.

ImageAnnotation objects have the shape:
```json
{
    "id": 3359,
    "annotations": [{
        "name": "Attribute Name",
        "value": "selected-value"
    }, {
        "name": "Another Attribute Name",
        "value": "selected-value"
    }]
}
```

### Image

An **image** is a representation of an image to which [`Annotations`](#annotation) will be applied.

Image objects have the shape:
```json
{
    "id": 3359,
    "url": "http://www.url.com/some-image.jpg",
    "width": 250,
    "height": 250
}
```

### Workload

A **workload** is an object containing a list of [`Images`](#image) to be annotated.

Workload objects have the shape:
```json
{
    "id": 121,
    "images": [{
        "id": 3359,
        "url": "http://url.com/some-image.jpg",
        "width": 250,
        "height": 250
    }, {
        "id": 3360,
        "url": "http://url.com/other-image.jpg",
        "width": 250,
        "height": 250
    }]
}
```

### AnnotatedWorkload

An **annotated workload** is a collection of [`ImageAnnotations`](#imageannotation) submitted for a specific [`Workload`](#workload).

Annotated Workload objects have the shape
```json
{
    "workloadId": 121,
    "images": [{
        "id": 3359,
        "annotations": [{
            "name": "Attribute Name",
